Is the distribution of the number of entries statistically different between rainy & non-rainy days?

YES

Describe your results and the methods used:

I used the Mann-Whitney U test to test whether there was significant difference between the mean ridership on rainy days versus non-rainy days. The p-value calculated is 0.024999, which means that we can say reject the null hypothesis that the mean ridership are the same on rainy vs non-rainy days with 97.5% confidence interval.
